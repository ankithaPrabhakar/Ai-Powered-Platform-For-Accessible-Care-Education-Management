🧩 AI-Powered Accessible Education & Care Finder

A web-based platform that helps families of children with disabilities easily discover nearby, accessible educational and care facilities using AI-driven personalization and location-based search.

This system focuses on solving a real and often overlooked problem:
families spend significant time manually searching, validating, and comparing institutions that match their child’s specific accessibility needs.

📌 Abstract

Finding suitable education and care resources for children with disabilities is difficult due to the lack of centralized, personalized, and accessibility-focused platforms.

This project introduces an AI-powered web platform that provides:

secure user profiles,

location-based discovery of institutions,

accessibility-aware filters,

feedback and rating systems,

and personalized recommendations using AI.

The platform bridges existing accessibility gaps and supports inclusive access to educational and care services, especially for underserved and marginalized communities.

📖 Introduction
Overview

The project aims to develop a smart web platform that helps families of children with disabilities find nearby educational and care institutions tailored to their individual needs.

Existing platforms generally lack:

detailed accessibility information,

personalized recommendations,

and disability-specific search filters.

This system addresses these limitations by integrating AI and geolocation services.

Objectives

Build a centralized web platform for accessible education and care resource management.

Implement AI-driven and location-based search functionality.

Provide detailed accessibility insights and a community feedback system.

Purpose

The platform reduces the manual effort involved in searching, verifying, and comparing facilities.
It ensures families receive reliable, inclusive and personalized results.

Scope

Key features

Secure user profiles

Location-based search

Detailed accessibility filters

Feedback and rating system

AI-powered recommendations

Methodology
